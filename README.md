Hello!

I am Florian, hobbyist software developer from Austria, currently working as a Product Manager for a health and fitness company. 
I enjoy coding in my free time and want to get into open source work, but have not yet found the time to do so.

I will updated this readme.md as soon as I can think of something more original to say.
